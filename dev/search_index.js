You especially want to make sure that METIS 5 is not accessible because the HSL library currently interfaced only supports METIS 4. If you have such library accessible, it is important to remove it from the library path, at least temporarily. For example, if you are on OSX and are using Homebrew, you can hide METIS 5 with brew unlink metis. After the install procedure is complete, it is fine to link metis again with brew link metis.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Set the environment variables HSL_MA57_PATH and HSL_MA97_PATH to specify where the source archives tar.gz are stored.

On Linux, Julia ≥ 1.8 is based on libgfortran version 5, whereas on macOS, they are based on libgfortran version 4. Thus for instance, versions of gcc/gfortran as recent as 11 are appropriate on Linux, but version 7 could be used on macOS.
