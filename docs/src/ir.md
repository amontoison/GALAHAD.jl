# Introduction

## sls_purpose Purpose

Given a sparse symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $A = a_{ij}$
and the factorization of $A$ found by the GALAHAD package SLS,
this package ** solves the system of linear equations $A x = b$ using
iterative refinement.**

Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.
