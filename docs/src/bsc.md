# Introduction

## Purpose

Given matrices $A$ and (diagonal) $D$, **build the
"Schur complement"
$S=A D A^T$** in sparse co-ordinate (and optionally sparse column)
format(s). Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix
$A$.

Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

 ## Call order

To solve a given problem, functions from the bsc package must be called
in the following order:

- bsc\_initialize - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures
- bsc\_read\_specfile (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file
- bsc\_import - set up matrix data structures for $A$.
- bsc\_reset\_control (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
- bsc_form - form the Schur complement $S$
- bsc\_information (optional) - recover information about
the process
- bsc\_terminate - deallocate data structures

##  Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

An unsymmetric $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$ may be presented and
stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

Both C-style (0 based)and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
Choose control.f_indexing as false for C style and true for
fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
indices for the corresponding fortran version.

Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
(fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

### Dense storage format

The matrix $A$ is stored as a compactdense matrix by rows, that is,
the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $n \ast i + j$of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
$0 \leq j \leq n-1$.

### Dense by columns storage format

The matrix $A$ is stored as a compactdense matrix by columns, that is,
the values of the entries of each column in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $m \ast j + i$of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
$0 \leq j \leq n-1$.

###  Sparse co-ordinate storage format

Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry, $0 \leq l \leq ne-1$, of $A$,
its row index i, column index j
and value $A_{ij}$,
$0 \leq i \leq m-1$,$0 \leq j \leq n-1$,are stored as
the $l$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
is recorded as A_ne = $ne$.

###  Sparse row-wise storage format

Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $A$ the i-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices j, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$, and values
$A_{ij}$ of thenonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = A_ptr(i), $\ldots$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,$0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

### unsymmetric\_matrix_column_wise Sparse column-wise storage format

Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
in column j+1. For the j-th column of $A$ the j-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
The row indices i, $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, and values $A_{ij}$
of thenonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components
l = A_ptr(j), $\ldots$, A_ptr(j+1)-1, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$,
of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
storage than the co-ordinate format.
